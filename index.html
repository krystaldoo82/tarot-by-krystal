			<p>Krystal is a small town woman just trying to make sense of the world. She has always had a talent for reading tarot cards and has been doing so for over 18 years, using the same deck all this time. She is intuitive and honest, and passes no judgement when it comes to lifes ups and downs. She understands that sometimes we make bad decisions but that doesn't make us a bad person.</p>

			<p>Not too long ago she learned she has a knack for knowing things about people from their photos. She was given photos of those that had passed and she intuitively just "knew" things about them and sometimes could get messages from them. She never knows how much information she will get.</p>

	      	<blockquote class="testimonial">"Dude, she picked up details like, my grandmother had this thing where she would put her hand on your arm. It was a loving thing she did, she wasn't very affectionate outside of that. The crocheting was very spot on... the things she said specifically addressed things I had been thinking about. 
Like I had received a reading the night before about my other grandparents and that grandma came through so I said " I hope you're ok with coming through again, sorry to bother you" So when Krystal said that I can call her anytime, she's always around, it was a direct response to what I said to her earlier."

	      	<blockquote class="testimonial">"Thanks for your reading. You are right I have been searching for meaning for a while now. I gave up my conventional job with pension to in order to become self employed, the work is less stable but more enjoyable. My concern about meeting someone is cos though still fertile I am on the wrong side of 45 so every month counts. I had a miscarriage 3 years ago and split with my unsupportive boyfriend after.  I have been oscillating between trying to accept I will never be a mother and beleiving I made those changes to create the right space for a good relationship to enter my life."
